Fulfills minimum criteria of handling the four basic operations with some caveats:
- the expectation is that the input is legitimate; e.g. doesn't handle repeated operators or missing operands around operators, etc.
- "=" doesn't repeat the previous functionality does like in the MacOS calculator.

Otherwise works fairly well.
Input "q" to quit gracefully.
